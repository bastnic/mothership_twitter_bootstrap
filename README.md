This is a Mothership subtheme for Drupal 7 theme built using Twitter Bootstrap.

Mothership presentation:

    The only thing this theme does is to clean up and remove html & classes that I dont think is necessary, and by that creating a cleaner html code.
    If youre not a html nerd that gets high by looking at html and enjoying the cleaner code, well then this "theme" is NOT for you.

Twitter bootstrap presentation:

    Bootstrap is a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites.
    It includes base CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, and more
